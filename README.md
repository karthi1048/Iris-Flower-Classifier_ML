# Iris-Flower-Classifier_ML

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for building a classifier model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

The notebook is organized as follows:

- Importing necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Loading the Iris dataset and performing initial exploration.
- Preprocessing the data by scaling features and handling missing values if any.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and relationships between them.
- Building a machine learning model using K-means clustering.- Further analysis using hierarchical clustering.

By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a well-organized codebase with comments to guide the reader through each step of the analysis and model building process.
